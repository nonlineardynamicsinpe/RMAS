RMAS: Reactive MultiAgent Systems.

This project is being developed at the National Institute for Space Research, as part of the PhD research project of Vander Freitas.

It is about Reactive MultiAgent Systems, focusing on the control of multiple mobile agents according to interaction rules. The agents play the role of vehicles heading to predefined paths. Paths are depicted by the so-called virtual agent whom is followed by the other agents. Those last are purely reactive, i.e., they only respond to the current state of the system, without keeping memory from previous interactions.
This virtual agent can be considered as a GPS signal evolving its position through time.
